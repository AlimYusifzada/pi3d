Description
===========

There's plenty of 3D code flying around at the moment for the Raspberry Pi, but much of it is rather complicated to understand and most of it can sit under the bonnet!

pi3d is a Python module that aims to greatly simplify writing 3D in Python whilst giving access to the power of the Raspberry Pi GPU.  It enables both 3D and 2D rendering and aims to provide a host of exciting commands to load in textured/animated models, create fractal landscapes, shaders and much more.

This is the second release of the pi3d module which has various demo's of built-in shapes, landscapes, model loading, walk-about camera and much more!  See the demos included with this code and experiment with them ..

  ForestWalk.py         Walk about a forest on a landscape
  Triceratops.py      	Large model loading
  BuckfastAbbey.py		A walk-about model
  LoadModel.py			The famous Utah teapot!
  Earth.py				Some shapes generated with Pi3D and a text demo
  BouncingBalls.py		2D rendering with a title bar
  Raspberry_Rain		Rendering onto the desktop
  Clouds3D.py			Blended sprites in perspective view
  CollisionBalls.py    	More bouncing balls across the screen - this time bouncing off each other
  EnvironmentCube.py   	New environment cubes to try out in texture/ecubes - some high quality ones!
  RobotWalkabout.py     Another off-planet example of a basic avatar robot drifting about
  Shapes.py             Demos available shapes and text

**** New Demos ****

  MegaStation.py       	Navigate around an abandoned Mars base-station with open/shut doors.
						Implements a new Level-Of-Detail (LOD) feature and TKwindow interface
  TigerTank.py    		Ever played WOT? This tank emulates how a WOT tank works.
						Uses realistic modelling and LODing in a TKwindow
						
Paddy Gaunt Demos

  Amazing.py			Can you find yourself around the amazing maze?
  Pong.py				A snazzy 3D version of landscape pinball and pong against a Raspberry!

Setup on the Raspberry Pi
=========================

1. Although most demos work on 64MB of memory, you are strongly advised to have a 128MB of graphics memory split,
   especially for full-screen 3D graphics.

!!IMPORTANT!! ...

2. Before trying any of the demos or Pi3D, you must download the Python Imaging Library as this is needed
   for importing any graphics used by Pi3.  To install on the terminal, type: 
   
      sudo apt-get install python-imaging

3. Geany is by far the easiest application to use for creating and running Python scripts. Download and
   install it with:

      sudo apt-get install geany xterm

4. Load any of the demos into Geany and run (using the cogs icon)
           
             
Documentation
=============

A short 'manual' on using pi3d can be found on this github.  Please note that Pi3D functions may change significantly during it's development.

Bug reports, comments, feature requests and fixes are most welcome!  Please email on timskillman@gmail.com or contact me through the Raspberry Pi forums.

Pi3D started with code based on Peter de Rivaz 'pyopengles' (https://github.com/peterderivaz/pyopengles) with some tweaking from Jon Macey's code (jonmacey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/).

Many Thanks, especially to Paddy Gaunt, Peter de Rivaz, Jon Macey and others who have contributed to Pi3D - keep up the good work!

A new version of Pi3D implementing Shaders will be available in the near future. Keep watch!
