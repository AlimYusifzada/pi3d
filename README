pi3D ReadMe
===========

There's plenty of 3D code flying around at the moment for the Raspberry Pi, but much of it is rather complicated to understand and most of it can sit under the bonnet!

pi3d is a Python module that aims to greatly simplify writing 3D in Python whilst giving access to the power of the Raspberry Pi GPU.  It enables both 3D and 2D rendering and it hopes to provide a host of exciting commands to load in textured/animated models, create fractal landscapes, shaders and much more.

However, the current state of pi3d will enable some basic 2D & 3D rendering within a window.  The examples included with the code can be tinkered with to see how they work;

  boxtest.py        Displays an animated textured box with the Raspberry Pi logo
  bouncingballs.py  Yes, bouncing balls which demonstrates sprite rendering in a 2D pixel-scaled window
  raspberry_rain.py Tumbling raspberry's over the desktop
  clouds3d.py       A demo in development that needs some tidying up (perhaps a challenge for you!)

Other files:

  pi3d.py           The main pi3d module
  gl.py, glext.py, egl.py, gl2.py, gl2ext.py are support files for pi3d.py

IMPORTANT: Please install the Python Imaging Library as this is used to load textures.
           To install on the terminal, type:  sudo apt-get install python-imaging

A short 'manual' on using pi3d will eventually be found on the github.  Please note that pi3d functions may change significantly during it's development.

pi3d started with code based on Peter de Rivaz 'pyopengles' (https://github.com/peterderivaz/pyopengles) and some tweaking from Jon Macey's code (jonmacey.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/).  Many Thanks!
