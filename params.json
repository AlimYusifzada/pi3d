It enables both 3D and 2D rendering and aims to provide a host of exciting commands to load in textured/animated models, create fractal landscapes, shaders and much more.\r\n\r\nThis is the third release of the pi3d module which has various demo's of built-in shapes, landscapes, model loading, walk-about camera and much more! See the demos included with this code and experiment with them ..\r\n\r\n\r\n# Demo's included with Pi3D\r\n\r\n1) **ForestWalk.py** Walk about a forest on a landscape generated from a bitmap\r\n\r\n![Forest Walk](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/ForestWalk_sml.png)\r\n\r\n2) **Triceratops.py** Large model loading with several bitmaps\r\n\r\n![Triceratops](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/Triceratops_sml.png)\r\n\r\n3) **BuckfastAbbey.py** Explore a model of the beautiful Buckfast Abbey in Buckfastleigh, Devon\r\n\r\n![Buckfast Abbey](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/BuckfastAbbey_sml.png)\r\n\r\n4) **Earth.py** Demonstrates semi-transparent clouds and hierarchical rotations \r\n\r\n![Earth](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/earthPic_sml.png)\r\n\r\n5) **BouncingBalls.py** 2D rendering with a title bar and 2D text \r\n\r\n![Bouncing Balls](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/bouncingballs_sml.png)\r\n\r\n6) **Raspberry_Rain.py** Raining Raspberries,  full-screen, over the desktop \r\n\r\n![Raspberry_Rain](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/raspberryRain_sml.png)\r\n\r\n7) **Clouds3D.py** Blended sprites in perspective view \r\n\r\n![Bounding Balls](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/clouds3d_sml.png)\r\n\r\n8) **CollisionBalls.py** More bouncing balls across the screen - this time bouncing off each other on the desktop\r\n\r\n![Bounding Balls](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/bouncingballs_sml.png)\r\n\r\n9) **EnvironmentCube.py** New environment cubes to try out in texture/ecubes - some high quality ones!\r\n\r\n![Bounding Balls](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/envcube_sml.png)\r\n\r\n10) **RobotWalkabout.py** Another off-planet example of a basic avatar robot drifting about\r\n\r\n![Bounding Balls](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/walkaboutRobot_sml.png)\r\n\r\n11) **Shapes.py** Demos available shapes and text in a 3D context\r\n\r\n![Bounding Balls](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/shapes_sml.png)\r\n\r\n12) **MarsStation.py** Navigate around an abandoned Mars base-station with open/shut doors. \r\nImplements a new Level-Of-Detail (LOD) feature and TKwindow interface\r\n\r\n![Mars Station](http://www.skillmanmedia.com/pi3d/images/MegaStation_sml.png)\r\n\r\n13) **TigerTank.py** Ever played World Of Tanks (WOT)?
