sprite Package
==============

This directory is intended to hold re-useable simple objects that have
added functionality. At the moment the `Missile` module has not been fully
developed and, as such, is purely a placeholder. Ball and its use in the
CollisionBalls.py demo is a good example of how functionality and general
'clutter' should be taken out of the main program into different classes.
